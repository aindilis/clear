# this is a system for programming the users's reading.

# It should take into account  the pedagogical objectives, and be in a
# race against time.

# it should therefore  determine what are the best  items to read, how
# much of  them to read, etc,  in the available  time, budgeting under
# the general assumption that time changes.

# example given  these pedagogical objectives,  needs to come  up with
# reading lists, etc, that satisfy these objectives.

# ; install openbsd
# vpn 80211[bi] wpa/rsn/peap/
# 8021X
# + windows file sharing (looking into samba protocols)
# + sniff traffic

# here was a human generated reading list for that.

# note that we could train the human generalted lists.
