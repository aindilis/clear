Here are  a few features that  would do this system  well.  First, the
sentence parsing, as well as the junk recognition, should be improved,
so that we minimize false positives and negatives.

We  also  want  to  add  the  ability to  speak  into  the  interface,
"clairvoyance, backward", and it will reread a sentence, etc.

More preprocessing is certainly necessary.  Better sentence splitter.

We want a flag  so that the system opens a viewer  for each file while
reading it.

Want a quizzer on acronyms.
