<pre class="example">Action Planner
Get Help
Self-Reliance
On Your Feet
</pre>

<p>
Hard to precisely define it.  This system, called Action Planner
hereout, grew out of work on the SPSE2 system, a personal task
management application.  SPSE2 can represent Goals and their
interdependencies, and can perform temporal planning and interactively
walk users through the resulting plans.  However, with the SPSE2
system, as many goals were being added, it became difficult to know
really which of the goals that could be accomplished were more
important and hence should be prioritized.

</p>

<p>
One approach is to sort the list of available goal activities by
asking a series of pairwise comparisons.  Another method from decision
science is to ask the user to rank the goals etc.  We will probably be
implementing the former at some point in time.  But, this system,
Action Planner, grew out of a desire to have the system help in the
selection of which goals to achieve, followed by their planning using
the temporal planner.  The idea is that if the temporal planner fails
to find a plan that satisfies all goals, to know which goals to ignore
first, and continue replanning (which is fairly efficient) until a
plan is found that SATISFICES all of the major things.  So for
instance, if you had two goals, one was "learn stroke prevention" and
another was "buy an HDTV", the system would be able to classify the
latter as being a luxury, and the former as being part of emergency
preparedness.  Then, using a system to compute priorities, it would,
barring unforeseen arguments in favor of the HDTV, say that the first
goal was more important because it improved other goals like "Get on
top of preparedness planning".  The idea with allowing contravening
arguments is that, while these goals have certain priorities such that
certain goals override others, it is possible that there are
complicated dependencies.  So for instance, if the HDTV was for a
person confined to hospice care with terminal cancer, such overriding
arguments could be brought to bear.  In AI, we call this
non-monotonic, defeasible or default reasoning (if an argument can be
overcome by another).  

</p>

<pre class="example">The canonical example is that you might have a system with the rule:
&quot;birds fly&quot;, and then you might add that &quot;Tweety is a bird&quot;, and so
deduce that &quot;Tweety can fly&quot;.  However, if you further add that
&quot;Tweety is a penguin&quot;, and &quot;penguins can't fly&quot;, then the original
assertion that &quot;Tweety can fly&quot; will be overridden.
</pre>

<p>
So, as has been mentioned briefly, there will be a system of
priorities, which understand the default rules regarding which goals
are more important than others.  This also relates to ethics,
especially deontic ethics.  Deontic logic is the logic of morality
concerning the moral status of duties.  So for instance, certain
actions are prohibited, others are obligatory, some or permissible,
and so on.  A similar system of non-monotonic reasoning about deontics
(as well as systems for virtue ethics and "the end justifies the
means" ethics) will be brought in to weigh on the importance of a task
from a moral perspective.

</p>

<p>
Knowledge of what happens when a goal fails to be accomplished, and
the severity of the consequences will also have a commonsense AI
implementation.  This will be part of the effects matrix.  Similarly,
we will try to reason with what happens to systems involved when there
are different failures, to help to develop plans that guard against
these problems.

</p>

<p>
The system will have a pairwise comparison that can compare between
two goals to determine which is more important.  Such a capabability
would be useful for solving related problems from microeconomics: the
expenditure minimization problem and the utility maximization problem.
(See <a href="UtilityMaximizationSystem.html">UtilityMaximizationSystem</a>).

</p>

<p>
That's an overview of the basic system.  The idea is to get it into a
position where it can assign scores to goals saying how important they
are.  The scores thus computed could be arrived at in a manner similar
to the AI techniques mentioned in the following two papers, except
that I don't mean exactly those techniques but an analogy to the
general process of taking all of the facts of a situation and applying
a set of processes to arrive at answers about the relative utility of
a goal.

</p>

<p>
Here is an example goal hierarchy, but unfortunately for military
purposes.

</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.isi.edu/soar/ifor/agent/">http://www.isi.edu/soar/ifor/agent/</a>

</p>

<p>
The action planner is partially implemented.  So far, it consists of
rules in the Expert System programming language called CLIPS.  Much
like the above linked GNUGo AI, the current CLIPS based Action Planner
code will take a static situation, expressed as a set of facts, and
compute a set of recommended moves for the agent, based on the rules.
That will be the Expert System component of the move generation phase.
The idea is that the situation is completely reevaluated at each
"step", just like with GNUGo.

</p>

<p>
(Note - Useful ideas for what are essentials can probably be found by
text mining the literature of survivalism.)

</p>

<p>
So, I need to work more on constructing the basic SPSE2 goal map that
includes all the sane goals an individual might have.  Some of the
goals may have to be recommended based on the users situation by the
move generator.  In general, the move generator and SPSE2 will talk to
each other using cape.sourceforge.net, and have redundant goal
representations.

</p>

<p>
So, for instance, here is the file that illustrates all of the facts
of a fictitious situation.  Feel free to skim them.

The next step then, are the rules.  Here are the rules thus added to the system.

That's just some of the rules.  The end result of running this is that
there are a lot more facts asserted about which goals a person should
have based on their situation.

So, just as in a game of Go, the situation/position could be
representing textually, we have a representation of the board of a
person's life.  Like GNUGo, we have the initial facts, and by
application of the rules we have the analysis, only in this case the
analysis phase is incomplete.  But hopefully, it will be able to
synthesize a coherent set of choices to be made and recommend the best
move for the position.  It seems to me silly that we have software
that can play a great game of Go (computer is playing White and is
clearly beating me (Black)), but the same cannot be said of a system
that helps one get on top of one's life, plan a good life, cover all
the bases, etc.

</p>

<p>
So, that's the status of the Action Planner at present.  What is
needed is to continue developing the taxonomy of needs and wants, to
implement the non-monotonic logic for determining an item's
importance.  Knowledge management approaches should be taken.  Pending
approval by the Free Software Foundation, I may consider using the
Java based Jena for the rules.

</p>

<p>
Naturally, we want as many good rules as we can think of.  Please send
me such rules.  We don't have to worry so much about rules drowning
each other out because hopefully information about the relative
importance of goals will outweigh the information about the goals, so
that we can always effectively know whether it is simple or not to
determine which goal is more important.

Update: Sun Apr 24 16:51:09 CDT 2011

</p>

<p>
I have completed preliminary extraction of properties from texts.  The
method chosen was thus.  I am using wikihow.com as a source of
Creative Commons licensed howtos.  I downloaded a bunch of these
howtos.  Given a single one, I run it through a script that extracts
the steps and possibly tips.  I extract the individual sentences and
then run them through the KNext system.  From there I post-process the
resulting information into a form that makes good properties.  To wit:

</p>

<pre class="example">Organize Paperwork at Home

Do you have piles of paper in your home that are overwhelming you? You can
organize them so you can actually find what you need when you need it. You can
cut the clutter by understanding what it is okay to throw out.

edit Steps

 1. 1
    Get some file folders and a pen. You will need 1 large box and a file box
    to put the files in. If you have many piles, start with the smallest.
 2. 2
    Eat the elephant one bite at a time. Mark boxes, TRASH, and FILE and begin
    sorting just on these two categories.
 3. 3
    If you keep an article of paper make a file for that subject, (example:
    Unpaid Bills). Put the bill in the file folder and label the tab Unpaid
    Bills and set it in the file box.
 4. 4
    Keep making files for whatever subject you need to file labeling them as
    you go. These could be anything you think is important to keep: birthday
    cards, car information, checking account, dental, home loan information,
    home maintenance, insurance, medical, unpaid bills, utilities, etc.
      + The best place to file something is where it is most obvious to you.
        Put things where you think they should go and it will be easiest for
        you to find them later.
 5. 5
    In another box marked &quot;Trash&quot; put in junk mail, duplicate bills, old papers
    that you know you will never really need.
 6. 6
    Touch it once. Either file it or throw it out.
 7. 7
    Make sub files if you want to. After you file your papers you might want to
    make files within files that are close to the same subject. For example,
    you could divide car information into car insurance, recalls/warranties,
    repairs,and copies of titles and registrations. This way you have all the
    info when you need it.
 8. 8
    Start at the mailbox for new papers that come in. When you get your mail
    out of your mailbox, go through right away and toss the junk. When you get
    into the house, make it a point to place it near your file cabinet. Choose
    a specific time that fits your schedule to open your mail and sort it on a
    daily basis. You could put unpaid bills in a folder in the front of the
    file box to help you to remember to pay them. File the important things and
    toss the rest in the trash can located next to your file cabinet.
 9. 9
    Use your calendar. Does a particular piece of paper require action or
    attendance at a later date? Write it in your calendar, then file the paper.
    You can even write where you filed the paper.
</pre>

<p>
I extract these sentences, and process with KNext, removing errors:

</p>

<pre class="example">$VAR1 = [
          'A BOX CAN BE LARGE.',
          'A PERSON MAY HAVE SOME_NUMBER_OF PILES.',
          'BOXES MAY TRASH.',
          'A MALE MAY HAVE BOXES.',
          'A PERSON MAY KEEP AN ARTICLE OF PAPER.',
          'AN ARTICLE CAN BE CONSTITUTED_OF_OR_FILLED_WITH PAPER.',
          'A FILE CAN BE FOR A SUBJECT.',
          'AN UNPAID[PERSON??] MAY HAVE BILLS.',
          'THINGS MAY GO.',
          'THINGS CAN BE PUT.',

<p>
Finally I will either manually prune them or work further to extract
rules in addition to properties.

</p>

<p>
So far, I have progressed with the extraction of properties.
Unfortunately, the extracted properties are not as good as I would
like, and there are tons of them that don't really make sense.  But by
a few heuristics I think I will be able to get to the good rules
rather quickly.

Here is a sample of the output data.

You can see all of the extracted properties here:

</p>

<p>
And here are the properties selected for inclusion so far:

</p>

<p>
These properties will be useful in doing positional analysis of a
persons life.  I will also process Sensei's net to extract Go
knowledge, and also recipes to extract recipe knowledge.  In fact, the
system is a (rather slow) ontology development system, most of the
work being done by KNext, but I will be making some additions that
extend that core functionality.

</p>

<p>
Another aspect of the life planner, once the positional attributes of
the "game" of life are known, will be actually developing a strategy.
Classically this might involve running a PDDL planner on a custom
domain.  However, another tack I'm investigating is the use of
so-called General Game Playing software.  Fortunately, a very winning
program has been released, called <a class="nonexistent" href="mailto:webmaster@aloysius.frdcsa.org">CadiaPlayer</a>, which is available for
download here:

</p>

<p>
I will be experimenting with generating a game which simulates aspects
of life, written in the corresponding GDL (Game Description
Language?).
